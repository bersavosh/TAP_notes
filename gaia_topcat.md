# Gaia Query in Topcat

In this example, I try to crossmatch a catalog I have on my machine against Gaia sources and also obtain the Beiler-jones distance estimates for these matches.

This requires two steps:

- Gaia Crossmatch (either with ADQL or upload match)

- Obtaining Bailer-Jones distances
